            <p>My name is Charlene Capili, and I consider myself as someone who is creative combined with a strong and logical mind. As a result, I developed passion for interactive design and web development. I am a problem-solver, and a very organized person with high attention to detail. I enjoy designing and coding things from scratch and bringing concepts to life on the internet, as well as passion for  UI design, brand identity, and design systems, as I value intuitive designs and thoughtful interactions.</p>
